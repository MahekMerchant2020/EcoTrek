# EcoTrek

This project aims to develop an application to track a person's energy and water consumption, waste generation, and other lifestyle metrics 
for calculating their carbon footprint based on the current values of emission factors.

Users are asked to input the amount of electricity and water consumed as stated on their energy bills for the month, the approximate quantity of domestic waste generated, 
the modes of transport used, and their food choices. The unit used for measuring the carbon footprint is kgCO2.

The final report discusses the data collection process, coding of the user interface in Java, as well as the possibilities for future development. 
The presentation offers a concise summary of the project.

Thank you!
